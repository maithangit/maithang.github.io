/*
Exercise 4:
Write code that will create person, student, and professor objects.
    • Person objects have
        o name and age fields
        o a greeting method that prints out: “Greetings, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old.”
        o a salute method that prints out: “Good morning!, and in case I dont see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night!”
    • Student objects inherit name, age, and salute from person. They also have a field ‘major’ and have their own greeting method. 
        Their greeting is “Hey, my name is [name] and I am studying [major]. The greeting should be output to the console.
    • Professor objects inherit name, age, and salute from person. They also have a field ‘department’ and have their own greeting method. 
        Their salutation is “Good day,
my name is [name] and I am in the [department] department.” Output it to the
console.
• Create a professor object and a student object. Call both the greeting and salutation
methods on each.
• Do this exercise once using the object prototype approach for inheritance and then
using the function constructor approach.
